# KS Data Retrieve from Remote Endpoint WordPress Plugin

The KS Data Retrieve from Remote Endpoint WordPress Plugin allows you to retrieves data from a remote endpoint and makes that data accessible via AJAX on the WordPress frontend using a shortcode.

## How to Use

From your WordPress administration panel go to `Plugins > Installed Plugins` and scroll down until you find `KS Data Retrieve from Remote Endpoint`. You will need to activate it first, then go to `Tools > Employees` to see it working.

There is a shortcode `ks_employees_list` to grab data and display in a table.
The shortcode runs Ajax endpoint to grab data.
